This folder contains the notebooks for all the experiments mentioned in the paper:

1. bert_cmv_finetune.ipynb: BERT finet-tune for the Change My View dataset with our 'combined contextual and structural features as text' sentence representation.
2. bert_cmv_w_features.ipynb: Feature concatenation for the Change My View dataset where the numerical structural features are concatenated with the BERT embedding.
3. bert_pe_finetune.ipynb: BERT fine-tune for the Persuasive Essays dataset with our 'combined contextual and structural features as text' sentence representation.
4. bert_pe_w_features.ipynb: Feature concatenation for the Persuasive Essays dataset where the numerical structural features are concatenated with the BERT embedding.
5. bert_ywc_finetune.ipynb: BERT fine-tune for the Yes We Can dataset with our 'combined contextual and structural features as text' sentence representation.
6. bert_ywc_w_features.ipynb: Feature concatenation for the Yes We Can dataset where the numerical structural features are concatenated with the BERT embedding.

For each notebook/experiment, different sentence representations can be selected as input to the BERT model by changing the column_name variable. A more detailed explanation is provided in the notebooks.
